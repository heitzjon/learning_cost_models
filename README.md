# Learning Cost Models (Query Optimization meets Deep Learning)

One of the key modules in query optimization are the cost models. This models deliver the estimations about how well a potential query plan performs. Faulty estimation can lead to sub optimal query plans. To minimize these errors we want to make cost models more data adaptive. We implemented alternative cost models based on deep learning, since traditional cost models are very complex and sometimes even work with non-theoretically grounded methods. It is a prove of concept implementation to compare against traditional cost models.
